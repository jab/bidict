        Return the hash of this frozen bidict from its contained items.

        Delegates to :attr:`_compute_hash` on the first call,
        then caches the result to make future calls *O(1)*.

        As a result, in the event that two distinct frozen bidict instances hash
        into the same bucket in a set or mapping, the time spent in ``__hash__``
        will generally be dominated by the time spent ``__eq__`` (which must be
        called to check if a hash collision between two unequal instances has
        actually occurred). If they are unequal, the ``__eq__`` call may short
        circuit in sublinear time, but in the worst case it will be *O(n)*. If
        they are equal, the call will always be *O(n)*. So, if inserting frozen
        bidicts into a set or mapping, the more items in the bidicts, the more
        the benefits of ``__hash__`` distributing unequal instances into
        different buckets.

        The result of :attr:`_compute_hash` is combined with the class in a
        final derived hash, to differentiate it from the hash of a different
        type of collection comprising the same items (e.g. frozenset or tuple).

        Because items are ordered,
        this uses Python's tuple hashing algorithm
        to compute a hash of the contained items.

        Python does not expose a way to use its tuple hashing algorithm on an
        arbitrary iterable, so to use the algorithm, an ephemeral tuple from
        the contained items must be created and passed to :func:`hash`.
        i.e. The space complexity of this method is not constant. However,
        on CPython, this results in the ``tuplehash`` routine implemented in
        ``tupleobject.c`` being used, so this is faster than computing the hash
        incrementally in pure Python, which could be done in constant space.

        Time and space complexity can be bounded by overriding
        :attr:`_HASH_NITEMS_MAX` to limit the number of items that participate
        in influencing the hash value. This is safe because contained items
        have a guaranteed ordering, so not all items need to participate in the
        hash to guarantee that two equal :class:`FrozenOrderedBidict`\ s have
        the same hash value, as long as both use the same :attr:`_HASH_NITEMS_MAX`.
