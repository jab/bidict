Learning from bidict
--------------------

One of the most rewarding things about bidict
is the outsized amount of advanced Python
it covers in light of its small codebase.

Check out :doc:`learning-from-bidict` [#fn-learning]_
if you're interested in learning more.


Contributing
------------

Bidict is currently a one-person operation
maintained on a voluntary basis
with no other sponsorship.
Your help would be most welcome!


Reviewers Wanted!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the most valuable ways to contribute to bidict
and to :doc:`explore some advanced Python <learning-from-bidict>`
while you're at it
is to review bidict's relatively small codebase.

Please create an issue or pull request with any improvements you'd propose
or any other results you found.
(Submitting a "Nothing-to-merge" PR with feedback in inline code comments or a
`Review results <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/new?title=Review+results>`_
issue both work well.)

.. The __ in `this issue <...>`__ below is to avoid the warning Sphinx emits
   ("Duplicate explicit target name")
   caused by the other `this issue <...>`_ link above. See:
   https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/3921#issuecomment-315581557

You can also
+1 `this issue <https://github.com/jab/bidict/issues/63>`__
to sign up to give feedback on future proposed changes
that are in need of a reviewer.


Funding
^^^^^^^

.. duplicated in CONTRIBUTING.rst
   (would use `.. include::` but GitHub doesn't understand it)

If bidict has helped you accomplish your work,
especially work you've been paid for,
please consider chipping in toward the costs
of bidict's maintenance and development
and/or ask your organization to do the same.
Any amount contributed is gratefully received.
