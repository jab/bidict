Bidict is the product of thousands of hours of my unpaid work
over the 12+ years I've been maintaining it.

If bidict has helped you accomplish your work,
especially work you've been paid for,
it's easy to
`sponsor me through GitHub <https://github.com/sponsors/jab>`__.

Choose a tier and GitHub handles everything else.
The sponsorship just goes on your regular GitHub bill;
there's nothing extra to do.
You can also sponsor me through
`Gumroad <https://gumroad.com/l/bidict>`__ or
