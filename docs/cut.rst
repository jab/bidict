Not Worth Reading?
==================

This whole page should maybe just get cut from the docs.

Stdlib Examples
---------------

The Python standard library actually contains some examples
where bidicts could be used for fun and profit
(depending on your ideas of fun and/or profit):

- The :mod:`logging` module
  contains a private ``_levelToName`` dict
  which maps integer levels like ``10`` to their string names like ``DEBUG``.
  If I had a nickel for every time I wanted that exposed in a bidict
  (and as a public attribute, no less), 
  I could buy myself some bigger nits to pick.

- Python 3's
  :mod:`html.entities` module /
  Python 2's
  :mod:`htmlentitydefs` module
  manually maintains
  :attr:`html.entities.name2codepoint` and
  :attr:`html.entities.codepoint2name` dicts
  separately by hand.
  (See what I did there?)

Other Verbiage, Esoterica, & Navel Gazing
-----------------------------------------

- It's intentional that the term "inverse" is used rather than "reverse".

  Consider a collection of *(k, v)* pairs.
  Taking the reverse of the collection can only be done if it is ordered,
  and (as you'd expect) reverses the order of the pairs in the collection.
  But each original *(k, v)* pair remains in the resulting collection.
  
  By contrast, taking the inverse of such a collection
  neither requires the collection to be ordered
  nor guarantees any ordering in the result,
  but rather just replaces every *(k, v)* pair
  with the inverse pair *(v, k)*.

- "keys" and "values" could perhaps more properly be called
  "primary keys" and "secondary keys" (as in a database),
  or even "forward keys" and "inverse keys", respectively.
  bidict sticks with the terms "keys" and "values"
  for the sake of familiarity and to avoid potential confusion,
  but it's worth noting that technically values are also keys themselves.

  Concretely, this allows us to return a set-like ``dict_keys`` object
  for :attr:`bidict.BidirectionalMapping.values` (Python 3) /
  :attr:`bidict.BidirectionalMapping.viewvalues` (Python 2),
  rather than a (non-set-like) ``dict_values`` object.

- A bidict ``b`` keeps a reference to its inverse ``b.inv``.
  By extension, its inverse bidict keeps a reference to it (``b.inv.inv is b``).
  So even when you no longer have any references to ``b``,
  its refcount will not drop to zero
  because its inverse still has a reference to it.
  Python's garbage collector will detect this
  and reclaim the memory allocated for a bidict
  when you no longer have any references to it.
  In other words, bidict won't leak memory
  as long as you don't ``gc.disable()``.
  If you do, reclaiming a bidict's memory is up to you,
  but if you're disabling GC you knew that already.
