Basic Usage
-----------

Let's return to the example from the :ref:`intro`::

    >>> from bidict import bidict
    >>> element_by_symbol = bidict(H='hydrogen')

As we saw, this behaves just like a dict,
but maintains a special :attr:`.inv <bidict.BidirectionalMapping.inv>` property
giving access to inverse mappings::

    >>> element_by_symbol.inv['helium'] = 'He'
    >>> del element_by_symbol.inv['hydrogen']
    >>> element_by_symbol
    bidict({'He': 'helium'})

The rest of the
:class:`collections.abc.MutableMapping` ABC
is also supported::

    >>> 'C' in element_by_symbol
    False
    >>> element_by_symbol.get('C', 'carbon')
    'carbon'
    >>> element_by_symbol.pop('He')
    'helium'
    >>> element_by_symbol
    bidict({})
    >>> element_by_symbol.update(Hg='mercury')
    >>> element_by_symbol
    bidict({'Hg': 'mercury'})
    >>> 'mercury' in element_by_symbol.inv
    True
    >>> element_by_symbol.inv.pop('mercury')
    'Hg'

Because inverse mappings are maintained alongside forward mappings,
referencing a bidict's inverse
is always a constant-time operation.

Values Must Be Hashable
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Because you must be able to look up keys by value as well as values by key,
values must also be hashable.

Attempting to insert an unhashable value will result in an error::

    >>> anagrams_by_alphagram = bidict(opt=['opt', 'pot', 'top'])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError...

In this example, using a tuple instead of a list does the trick,
and confers additional benefits of immutability::

    >>> bidict(opt=('opt', 'pot', 'top'))
    bidict({'opt': ('opt', 'pot', 'top')})


Interop
+++++++

bidicts interoperate well with other types of maps.
For example, they support (efficient) polymorphic equality testing::

    >>> bidict(a=1) == dict(a=1)
    True

And converting back and forth works as expected::

    >>> dict(bidict(a=1))
    {'a': 1}
    >>> bidict(dict(a=1))
    bidict({'a': 1})

Hopefully bidict feels right at home
among the Python built-ins you already know.

Let's turn now to considering bidict's :ref:`performance`.
