Performance
-----------

:mod:`bidict` strives to be as performant as possible
while being faithful to its purpose.
The need for speed
is balanced with the responsibility
to protect users from shooting themselves in the foot.

In general,
accomplishing some task using :mod:`bidict`
should have about the same performance
as keeping two inverse dicts in sync manually.
The test suite includes benchmarks for common workloads
to catch any performance regressions.

If you spot a case where :mod:`bidict`'s performance could be improved,
please don't hesitate to
:doc:`file an issue or submit a pull request <contributors-guide>`.


``bidict`` Avoids Reference Cycles
----------------------------------

A careful reader might notice the following...

.. testsetup::

   from bidict import bidict

.. doctest::

   >>> fwd = bidict(one=1)
   >>> inv = fwd.inverse
   >>> inv.inverse is fwd
   True

...and worry that a :class:`~bidict.bidict` and its inverse
create a reference cycle.
If this were true,
in CPython this would mean that the memory for a :class:`~bidict.bidict`
could not be immediately reclaimed when you retained no more references to it,
but rather would have to wait for the next garbage collection to kick in
before it could be reclaimed.

However, :class:`~bidict.bidict`\s use a :class:`weakref.ref`
to store the inverse reference in one direction,
avoiding the strong reference cycle.
As a result, when you no longer retain
any references to a :class:`~bidict.bidict` you create,
you can be sure that its refcount in CPython drops to zero,
and that its memory will therefore be reclaimed immediately.

.. note::

   In PyPy this is not an issue, as PyPy doesn't use reference counts.
   The memory for unreferenced objects in PyPy is only reclaimed
   when GC kicks in, which is unpredictable.


Terminology
-----------

- It's intentional that the term "inverse" is used rather than "reverse".

  Consider a collection of *(k, v)* pairs.
  Taking the reverse of the collection can only be done if it is ordered,
  and (as you'd expect) reverses the order of the pairs in the collection.
  But each original *(k, v)* pair remains in the resulting collection.

  By contrast, taking the inverse of such a collection
  neither requires the collection to be ordered
  nor guarantees any ordering in the result,
  but rather just replaces every *(k, v)* pair
  with the inverse pair *(v, k)*.

- "keys" and "values" could perhaps more properly be called
  "primary keys" and "secondary keys" (as in a database),
  or even "forward keys" and "inverse keys", respectively.
  :mod:`bidict` sticks with the terms "keys" and "values"
  for the sake of familiarity and to avoid potential confusion,
  but technically values are also keys themselves.

  Concretely, this allows :class:`~bidict.bidict`\s
  to return a set-like (*dict_keys*) object
  for :meth:`~bidict.bidict.values`,
  rather than a non-set-like *dict_values* object.


Missing ``bidict``\s in the Standard Library
--------------------------------------------

The Python standard library actually contains some examples
where :class:`~bidict.bidict`\s could be used for fun and profit
(depending on your ideas of fun and profit):

- The :mod:`logging` module
  contains a private ``_levelToName`` dict
  which maps integer levels like *10* to their string names like *DEBUG*.
  If I had a nickel for every time I wanted that exposed in a bidirectional map
  (and as a public attribute, no less),
  I bet I could afford some better turns of phrase.

- The :mod:`dis` module
  maintains a mapping from opnames to opcodes
  ``dis.opmap``
  and a separate list of opnames indexed by opcode
  ``dis.opnames``.
  These could be combined into a single bidict.

- Python 3's
  :mod:`html.entities` module
  maintains separate
  ``html.entities.name2codepoint`` and
  ``html.entities.codepoint2name`` dicts.
  These could be combined into a single bidict.


Caveats
-------

Non-Atomic Mutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As with built-in dicts,
mutating operations on a :class:`~bidict.bidict` are not atomic.
If you need to mutate the same :class:`~bidict.bidict` from different threads,
use a
`synchronization primitive <https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#lock-objects>`__
to coordinate access. [#]_

Equivalent but distinct :class:`~collections.abc.Hashable`\s
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consider the following:

.. doctest::

   >>> d = {1: int, 1.0: float}

How many items do you expect *d* to contain?
The actual result might surprise you:

.. doctest::

   >>> len(d)
   1

And similarly,

.. doctest::

   >>> dict([(1, int), (1.0, float), (1+0j, complex), (True, bool)])
   {1: <... 'bool'>}
   >>> 1.0 in {True}
   True

(Note that ``1 == 1.0 == 1+0j == True``.)

This illustrates that a mapping cannot contain two items
with equivalent but distinct keys
(and likewise a set cannot contain two equivalent but distinct elements).
If an object that is being looked up in a set or mapping
is equal to a contained object,
the contained object will be found,
even if it is distinct.

With a :class:`~bidict.bidict`,
since values function as keys in the inverse mapping,
this behavior occurs in the inverse direction too,
and means that a :class:`~bidict.bidict` can end up with a different
but equivalent key from the corresponding value
in its own inverse:

.. doctest::

   >>> b = bidict({'false': 0})
   >>> b.forceput('FALSE', False)
   >>> b
   bidict({'FALSE': False})
   >>> b.inverse
   bidict({0: 'FALSE'})


*nan* as a Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In CPython, *nan* is especially tricky when used as a dictionary key:

.. doctest::

   >>> d = {float('nan'): 'nan'}
   >>> d
   {nan: 'nan'}
   >>> d[float('nan')]  # doctest: +SKIP
   Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
   KeyError: nan
   >>> d[float('nan')] = 'not overwritten'
   >>> d  # doctest: +SKIP
   {nan: 'nan', nan: 'not overwritten'}

In other Python implementations such as PyPy,
*nan* behaves just like any other dictionary key.
But in CPython, beware of this unexpected behavior,
which applies to :class:`~bidict.bidict`\s too.
:mod:`bidict` contains no special-case logic
for dealing with *nan* as a key,
so bidict's behavior will match :class:`dict`'s
on whatever runtime you're using.

See e.g. `these docs
<https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cpython_differences.html>`__
for more info (search the page for "nan").

Simultaneous assignment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
bidict :class:`~bidict.bidict` behaves differently than built-in dict with respect to simultaneous assignment. For example, for a built-in dict e.g. ``b = {1:1, 2:2}`` one can swap two values with ``b[1], b[2] = b[2], b[1]``, which results in ``b`` being equal to ``{1:2, 2:1}`` but if ``b = bidict({1:1, 2:2})`` then ``b[1], b[2] = b[2], b[1]`` results in a ``KeyAndValueDuplicationError: (1, 2)`` and to swap the values one must run:

    >>> val2 = b.pop(2)
    >>> b[1],b[2] = val2, b[1]

This limitation is a direct consequence of the fact that the statement ``b[1], b[2] = b[2], b[1]`` is by definition equivalent to

    >>> _temporary_internal_tuple = b[2], b[1]
    >>> b[1] = _temporary_internal_tuple[0]
    >>> b[2] = _temporary_internal_tuple[1]

as described in https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html docs.
