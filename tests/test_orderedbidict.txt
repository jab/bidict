Test for consistency in ordered bidicts after handling duplicate keys/values
(when passing python's -O flag, this would previously fail
due to reliance on side effects in assert statements)::

    >>> from bidict import OrderedBidict, DuplicationError, RAISE, OVERWRITE
    >>> b = OrderedBidict([(0, 1)])
    >>> exc = None
    >>> try:
    ...     b.update([(0, 2), (3, 4), (5, 4)])
    ... except DuplicationError as e:
    ...     exc = e
    >>> exc is not None
    True
    >>> len(b.inv)
    1

    >>> exc = None
    >>> try:
    ...     b.putall([(2, 1), (2, 3)], on_dup_key=RAISE, on_dup_val=OVERWRITE)
    ... except DuplicationError as e:
    ...     exc = e
    >>> exc is not None
    True
    >>> len(b)
    1

    >>> b.forceupdate([(0, 1), (2, 3), (0, 3)])
    >>> b
    OrderedBidict([(0, 3)])
