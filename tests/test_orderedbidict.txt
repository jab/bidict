Test for consistency in ordered bidicts after handling duplicate keys/values
(when passing python's -O flag, this would previously fail
due to reliance on side effects in assert statements)::

    >>> from bidict import LooseOrderedBidict
    >>> b = LooseOrderedBidict([(0, 1), (2, 3), (0, 3)])
    >>> len(b) == 1
    True
    >>> 2 in b
    False
